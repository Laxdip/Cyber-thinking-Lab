# How I Would Hack This (Threat Thinking Project)

## 🎯 Goal
To demonstrate how attackers identify weak points in everyday systems
**without performing any real attack**.

This project focuses on **thinking, not exploiting**.

## 🖥 Scenario Chosen
Example: Home Wi-Fi Network / College Network / Small Office Setup

## 👿 Attacker’s Thinking
If I were an attacker, I would first look for:
- Exposed entry points
- Weak authentication
- Misconfigured services
- Human mistakes

### Possible Attack Surfaces
- Router admin panel
- Weak Wi-Fi passwords
- Open ports
- Default credentials
- Unpatched devices

## 🛡 Defender’s Fix
To secure the system:
- Strong passwords
- Disable unused services
- Firmware updates
- Network segmentation
- Monitoring logs

## ❌ Common Mistakes
- Trusting default settings
- Ignoring firmware updates
- Reusing passwords

## 📌 Key Takeaway
Most systems are hacked **not because of advanced exploits,
but because of simple mistakes**.
