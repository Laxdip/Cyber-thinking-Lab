# Cyber Thinking Lab 🧠🔐

This repository focuses on **cybersecurity thinking**, not just tools.

The goal is to understand:
- 👿 How attackers think
- 🛡 How defenders prevent attacks
- ❌ Common silent mistakes
- ✅ Simple but effective security fixes

All projects are **legal, ethical, and tested only on owned systems or lab environments**.

## 📂 Project Philosophy
Instead of complex tools, this lab focuses on:
- Real-world scenarios
- Misconfigurations attackers love
- Logs, behavior, and patterns
- Security awareness for humans, not just machines

## 🚀 Projects
Each folder represents one focused cybersecurity concept with:
- Clear explanation
- Attacker vs Defender thinking
- Practical security lessons

> “Good security starts with understanding how systems fail quietly.”
